<p>whos model was the Hodgkin-Huxley type model of the set of sodium,
potassium, and leakage channels found in the hippocampal mossy fiber
boutons as described in

<p>This model was contributed by H Kamiya.
</p>
<p>Two illustrations show the simulation configuration in which sodium
and potassium conductance was omitted from the axon and the bouton
compartments shown in red.
</p>
<p>To run the simulations, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>compile the mod files using nrnivmodl under Mac OS X and Linux, or
mknrndll under Windows
  </li><li>run mosinit.hoc in NEURON. Clicking Init &amp; Run button in RunControl
panel performs the simulation of propagating action potentials along
mossy fiber axons and plots the results using NEURON's graphical user
interface.
  </li><li>click radio buttons in the panel "passive_propagation" and click
"Init &amp; Run" in the RunControl panel to perform simulation shown in
Figs. 4G and 4H.
</li></ol>
<p>
  Here are screenshots of pressing the successive buttons available in the GUI that is presented when you start the simulation:</p>
