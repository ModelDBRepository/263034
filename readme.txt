This is the Hodgkin-Huxley type model of the set of sodium, potassium, 
and leakage channels found in the hippocampal mossy fiber boutons. as described in

"Presynaptic action potential amplification by voltage-gated Na+ channels in
 hippocampal mossy fiber boutons" Neuron 45:405-417 (2005).

Two illustrations show the simulation configuration in which sodium and potassium 
conductance was omitted from the axon and the bouton compartments shown in red.

To run the simulations, follow these steps:

1. compile the mod files using nrnivmodl under Mac OS X and Linux, or
mknrndll under Windows

2. run mosinit.hoc in NEURON. Clicking Init & Run button in RunControl panel
performs the simulation of propagating action potentials along mossy fiber axons 
and plots the results using NEURON's graphical user interface.

3. click radio buttons in the panel "passive_propagation" and click "Init & Run" 
in the RunControl panel to perform simulation shown in Figs. 4G and 4H.

Questions about this model should be directed to kamiya@med.hokudai.ac.jp.
